1. Deck.

2. Better modularization/reuse of the transition.

3. Is it possible to have the (negative) margin of the card in the (flex) container, instead of having it in each card?
A: yes, with inner style in the container style.

4. OnSpill, and other events like onUpdate, onSort, etc.
And also highlight each dropping area. Always(1) and/or during hover(2). If both, use two different styles.

5. Centralize animation time.

6. Move all fixed css styles from cards to their container. Like it was partially done with Deck.

7. Uniformize other-players/partner. (source/destination id)

8. Maybe have uuid for each card. Or even sequenced IDs after shuffling. And hide card details until revelation to each player.

9. Remove the move information from the context after its completion.
