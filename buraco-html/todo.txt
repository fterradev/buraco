1. Deck.

2. Better modularization/reuse of the transition.

3. Is it possible to have the (negative) margin of the card in the (flex) container, instead of having it in each card?
A: yes, with inner style in the container style.

4. OnSpill, and other events like onUpdate, onSort, etc.
And also highlight each dropping area. Always(1) and/or during hover(2). If both, use two different styles.
